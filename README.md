# k0s apps

This repository contains the yaml definitions of terminal applications that could be exposed to the public via [k0s](https://k0s.io). 
They are mainly created for demo purpose and could be restarted or removed at any time. If you find some of them useful, please consider deploying them on your own k3s/k8s cluster to avoid losing state.
